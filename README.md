## Hi there! My name is Jorge,

I am happy to present my portfolio as a Full Stack Developer, in 2020 I decide to change my career path from a Industrial Designer to Developer.

I am currently searching for my future job as Developer where I can learn and contribute with my special mix of skills and knowledge, but I want to work with people who want to make people's life easier and at the same time thinking in the side effects that might cost to the enviroment. We most to find that balance and rethink what is really important as a part of this planet.

Check more about what I can do and get in touch!
